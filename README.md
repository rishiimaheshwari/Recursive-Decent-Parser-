# Recursive-Decent-Parser

## Overview

This project is a simple yet powerful application designed to validate grammar, parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions using a recursive descent parser. Built with Python and Tkinter, this tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy input and evaluation of expressions, making it a perfect tool for educational purposes, quick calculations, or as a foundation for more complex projects.

## Features

- **Recursive Descent Parser**: Utilizes a recursive descent parser to handle arithmetic expressions.
- **GUI with Tkinter**: User-friendly graphical interface for inputting expressions and displaying results.
- **Optional Grammar Input**: Flexibility to input custom grammar rules for parsing.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully.
- **Support for Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses.
